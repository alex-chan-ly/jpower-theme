				<span class="font-about-special3">2. Why is there variation of color and size in each piece of tile?</span>
				<ol style="list-style: none;">
					<li>
						Tiles are formed under high heat and there might be slight variation in color and actual size even in the same batch.&nbsp; The QC system has ensured each batch of delivery is within industry tolerance of color and size variation.&nbsp; Some degree of variation is not treated as a problem but a deliberate attempt to create natural effect.<br />
